# python-crawler
A few crawler using Selenium I wrote for fun.

In qq-zone crawler, I used Selenium to simulate the login in process and download the blog by simple IO. I was inspired by [this blog](https://blog.csdn.net/yanbober/article/details/73822475), which download images from qq-zone.

In leetcode crawler, I used ReportLab to assemble the downloaded file into a PDF. Later I want to also crawl the solutions and hints.


In the future, I may write more.
