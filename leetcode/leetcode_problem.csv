0,Two Sum,Easy,"Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
 "
1,Add Two Numbers,Medium,"You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
Example
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807."
2,Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters,Medium,"Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given ""abcabcbb"", the answer is ""abc"", which the length is 3.
Given ""bbbbb"", the answer is ""b"", with the length of 1.
Given ""pwwkew"", the answer is ""wke"", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, ""pwke"" is a subsequence and not a substring."
3,Median of Two Sorted Arrays,Hard,"There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
Example 2:
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5"
4,Longest Palindromic Substring,Medium,"Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.
Example 1:
Input: ""babad""

Note: ""aba"" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:
Input: ""cbbd""
Output: ""bb"""
5,ZigZag Conversion,Medium,"The string ""PAYPALISHIRING"" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: ""PAHNAPLSIIGYIR""
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
string convert(string s, int numRows);
Example 1:
Input: s = ""PAYPALISHIRING"", numRows = 3

6,Reverse Integer,Easy,"Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
Example 1:
Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [?231,  231 ? 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows."
7,String to Integer (atoi),Medium,"Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.
The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
Note:
Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [?231,  231 ? 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 ? 1) or INT_MIN (?231) is returned.
Example 1:
Input: ""42""
Output: 42
Example 2:
Input: ""   -42""
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.
Example 3:
Input: ""4193 with words""
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.
Example 4:
Input: ""words and 987""
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
Example 5:
Input: ""-91283472332""
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number ""-91283472332"" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (?231) is returned."
8,Palindrome Number,Easy,"Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
Example 1:
Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Follow up:
Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?"
9,Regular Expression Matching,Hard,"Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
Note:
s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.
p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
Example 1:
Input:
s = ""aa""
p = ""a""
Output: false
Explanation: ""a"" does not match the entire string ""aa"".
Example 2:
Input:
s = ""aa""
p = ""a*""
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the precedeng element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes ""aa"".
Example 3:
Input:
s = ""ab""
p = "".*""
Output: true
Explanation: "".*"" means ""zero or more (*) of any character (.)"".
Example 4:
Input:
s = ""aab""
p = ""c*a*b""
Output: true
Explanation: c can be repeated 0 times, a can be repeated 1 time. Therefore it matches ""aab"".
Example 5:
Input:
s = ""mississippi""
p = ""mis*is*p*.""
Output: false"
10,Container With Most Water,Medium,"Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

25,Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,Easy,"Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.

Output: ""10101"""
67,Text Justification,Hard,"Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
Note:
A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.
Example 1:
Input:
words = [""This"", ""is"", ""an"", ""example"", ""of"", ""text"", ""justification.""]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   ""This    is    an"",
   ""example  of text"",
   ""justification.  ""

Input:
words = [""What"",""must"",""be"",""acknowledgment"",""shall"",""be""]
maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  ""What   must   be"",
  ""acknowledgment  "",
  ""shall be        ""
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is ""shall be    "" instead of ""shall     be"",
             because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
             Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
Example 3:
Input:
words = [""Science"",""is"",""what"",""we"",""understand"",""well"",""enough"",""to"",""explain"",
         ""to"",""a"",""computer."",""Art"",""is"",""everything"",""else"",""we"",""do""]

Corner Cases:
    Did you consider the case where path = ""/../""?
In this case, you should return ""/"".
Another corner case is the path might contain multiple slashes '/' together, such as ""/home//foo/"".
In this case, you should ignore redundant slashes and return ""/home/foo""."

79,Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II,Medium,"Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
Example 1:
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:
Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
Internally you can think of this:

80,Search in Rotated Sorted Array II,Medium,"Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
Follow up:
This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?"
81,Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II,Medium,"Given a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list.

83,Largest Rectangle in Histogram,Hard,"Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
 
The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
  Example:
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10"
84,Maximal Rectangle,Hard,"Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
Example:
Input:
[
  [""1"",""0"",""1"",""0"",""0""],
  [""1"",""0"",""1"",""1"",""1""],

]
Output: 6"
85,Partition List,Medium,"Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.
You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.
Example:
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5"
86,Scramble String,Hard,"Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.
Below is one possible representation of s1 = ""great"":
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.
For example, if we choose the node ""gr"" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string ""rgeat"".
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
We say that ""rgeat"" is a scrambled string of ""great"".
Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes ""eat"" and ""at"", it produces a scrambled string ""rgtae"".
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
We say that ""rgtae"" is a scrambled string of ""great"".
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.
Example 1:
Input: s1 = ""great"", s2 = ""rgeat""
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: s1 = ""abcde"", s2 = ""caebd""
Output: false"
87,Merge Sorted Array,Easy,"Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
Note:
The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
Example:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]"
88,Gray Code,Medium,"The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
For example, given n = 2, return [0,1,3,2]. Its gray code sequence is:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
Note:
For a given n, a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that."
89,Subsets II,Medium,"Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).
Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Example:

Example 1:
Input: ""12""
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as ""AB"" (1 2) or ""L"" (12).
Example 2:
Input: ""226""
Output: 3
Explanation: It could be decoded as ""BZ"" (2 26), ""VF"" (22 6), or ""BBF"" (2 2 6)."
91,Reverse Linked List II,Medium,"Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in one-pass.
Note: 1 ? m ? n ? length of list.

97,Validate Binary Search Tree,Medium,"Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
